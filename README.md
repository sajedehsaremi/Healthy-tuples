# P1--healthy-tuples


Objective: To build a model that predicts heart disease in a subject. (note the target column to predict is 'TenYearCHD' where CHD = Coronary heart disease)
perform the following steps:
Read the file and display columns and describe the datatypes.
Handle missing values by replacing missing value with mean, Outliers and Duplicate Data.
graph all the data using correlation graph to identify outliers which will help predict the CHD
graph all the categories that has strong correlation with CHD
calculate the percentage of each health factors to see how they are related to CHD.
