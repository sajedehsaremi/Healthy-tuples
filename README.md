# P1--healthy-tuples
**Background:**
Heart disease accounts for 12.6 million deaths per year worldwide.  Cardiovascular disease account for significant portion of morbidity and mortality in developed nations, especially the United States.  Early detection or risk stratification can aid in reducing the prevalence of heart disease by prompting lifestyle changes or medication treatment.  However, it is unclear who is at risk or who would benefit from preventative treatment.  We aim to identify patients who are at risk for developing heart disease. 

**Project Goal:**
To predict heart disease based on patient characteristics

**Dataset:**
Our dataset is based on the Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1948 following over 4,000 patients to understand the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease.  Our dataset is publicly available (https://github.com/sajedehsaremi/P1--healthy-tuples/tree/main/output_data) and includes data fields such as gender, age, education, smoking history, blood pressure treatment, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, total cholesterol, blood measure metrics, body mass index (BMI), heart rate, and glucose levels.  

**Outcome:**
In this project, we will look at prevalence of different risk factors, and see which ones are common with development of heart disease.
