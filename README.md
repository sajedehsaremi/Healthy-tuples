# P1--healthy-tuples


Objective: To build a model that predicts heart disease in a subject. (note the target column to predict is 'TenYearCHD' where CHD = Coronary heart disease)
perform the following steps:
Read the file and display columns and describe the datatypes.
Handle missing values by replacing missing value with mean, Outliers and Duplicate Data.
graph all the data using correlation graph to identify outliers which will help predict the CHD
graph all the categories that has strong correlation with CHD
calculate the percentage of each health factors to see how they are related to CHD.

#### 1. Find correlation between all the health conditions from the data sets.
#### 2. Identify the outliers from the correlations
#### 3. Graph Gender VS 10 year CHD
#### 4. Graph Education impact on 10 year CHD
#### 5. Graph smokers per day VS 10 year CHD
#### 6. Graph each outliers VS 10 year CHD
#### 7. Graph each outliers that are out of normal range and and plot it VS 10 year CHD
#### 8. Calculate each outliers that are out of normal range and show the percentage of population developed CHD
#### 9. Analyze step 8 to see the patterned of the percentage of population developed CHD in 10 years.
#### 10. Conclusion - If you give me your actual number for each outliers, i can maybe predict percentage of you developing CHD in 10 years.
